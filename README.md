# AzurLaneMC
What is Azur Lane MC?

ALMC is a mod that, in full scope, emphasizes exploration, resource management, siege mechanics, and NPC interaction.

As the steward of your Minecraft world, you will be given the opportunity (and responsibility) of managing a fleet of anthropomorphic naval vessels. Manufacture weaponry, utilities, and ammunition to supply a ship adequately, so that she can safely explore, gather resources, and even defend the living against all manner of mobs (drowned, guardians.... and even the elusive Siren).

Deployment is only half of the story. You'll also need to keep an eye on morale and interpersonal relationships. Build and design dormitories that cater to the preferences of each ship... watch as they interact with each other and form bonds that can strengthen (or devastate) them in combat... and also keep an eye out for logistics. You won't be alone, as you can recruit adorable creatures to help you manage food, fuel, production, and the emotional disaster from losing a party member in combat! (Unlike the mobile game, you will need to be strategic about who you send out, because NPC death is a real risk in this mod!)

Come aboard, Commander, and test your fleet-managing chops in this mod!
